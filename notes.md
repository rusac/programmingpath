Loops:

"A loop ends, when the condition is met, or the program encounters the keyword `break`; anything else is not a graceful exit."

Clean Code:

1.    Variables are nouns: ( hourly_rate )
2.    Functions that do something are verbs: ( compute_sum() )
3.    Functions returning a boolean are questions: ( is_max() )
